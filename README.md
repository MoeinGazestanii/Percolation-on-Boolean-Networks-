# Percolation-on-Boolean-Networks-
Percolation describes the behavior of connected clusters in a random graph.

Objective: Study the numerical behavior of percolation in Boolean networks on the plane R square.â€‹

Key Concept: Percolation theory examines how cluster sizes in large random networks change as the probability of connectivity varies, undergoing a sharp transition at the percolation threshold.
